## What is NGINX?
NGINX is an open-source web server and reverse proxy used to serve both static and dynamic content. In addition, NGINX can function as a load balancer, an SMTP server for sending emails, and as a tool for optimizing performance with caching and SSL/TLS termination. It was developed in 2004 by Russian programmer Igor Sysoev, with the goal of addressing performance issues in handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

## How Does NGINX Work?
NGINX is particularly well-known for its asynchronous architecture, which means it can handle a large amount of traffic without using excessive system resources. Unlike traditional process-based servers (like Apache), NGINX uses a single or a few worker processes to efficiently handle multiple requests at the same time.

### Key Features:
 - Asynchronous Architecture: NGINX can handle a large number of HTTP requests concurrently using far fewer resources compared to process-based servers.
 - Speed and Efficiency: NGINX is optimized for high performance and can serve a large number of simultaneous connections without slowing down.
 - Low Resource Usage: Due to its architecture, NGINX uses far less CPU and memory, making it ideal for high-traffic systems.

# Roles of NGINX

1. Web Server
Most commonly, NGINX is used as a web server that serves static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos. Its efficiency in handling a large number of simultaneous connections allows websites to use NGINX to serve content quickly and securely.

2. Reverse Proxy
As a reverse proxy, NGINX takes HTTP requests from clients and forwards them to appropriate backend servers (such as Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby applications). This helps with scalability and security, as the backend servers are hidden behind NGINX, and traffic is optimized.

A reverse proxy is also commonly used for load balancing, which helps distribute traffic across multiple backend servers.

3. Load Balancer
NGINX is frequently used for load balancing between multiple servers, distributing incoming traffic across different resources. This improves performance and ensures high availability for applications. NGINX supports various load balancing methods, including round-robin, least connections, and IP-hash.

4. SSL/TLS Termination
NGINX is used for SSL/TLS termination, meaning it takes care of encrypting and decrypting HTTPS traffic. This reduces the load on backend servers and ensures secure communication with clients.

5. Caching
NGINX enables caching at the HTTP response level, which means it can store frequently requested resources (like images and HTML pages) in memory and serve them quickly to users. This reduces load on servers and speeds up page loading times.

## Advantages of NGINX
 - High Performance: NGINX is designed to handle tens of thousands of simultaneous connections, even on machines with minimal resources. This makes it perfect for websites with large numbers of visitors and dynamic content.

 - Low Resource Usage: Unlike traditional web servers, NGINX is highly efficient in using memory and CPU. This allows servers to handle more traffic without needing additional resources.

 - High Scalability: Due to its architecture and ability to balance traffic across multiple servers, NGINX is perfect for scalable systems. It allows you to easily increase your website’s capacity by adding more backend servers.

 - Security: By using NGINX as a reverse proxy, you can enhance security by hiding your applications and backend servers from direct exposure to external users. NGINX also allows you to implement SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring secure communication with clients.

 - Easy Configuration: NGINX’s configuration files are simple and text-based. Basic configurations can be set up in a few minutes, and the flexibility and extensibility of NGINX make it possible to set up more complex configurations with just a few lines of code.

# How to Set Up NGINX on Your Server?

To set up NGINX on your server, follow these steps (using an Ubuntu server as an example):

1. Install NGINX:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

2. Set Up Basic Configuration:

- Open the configuration file:

```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

- Enter the following basic configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

3. Start NGINX:

- After making your changes, start NGINX:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

4. Test:

 - Visit http://your-server-ip/ in your browser and check if the site is live.

NGINX is an incredibly powerful, fast, and efficient tool for managing web traffic. Its advantages, such as high scalability, low resource usage, and flexibility, make it an excellent choice for any web developer or system administrator. Whether you're using it as a web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, or for SSL/TLS termination, NGINX can significantly improve the performance and security of your applications.


# Some more important commands

- Stopping NGINX

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

- Restarting NGINX

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

- Reloading NGINX Configuration

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

- Checking the Status of NGINX

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

- Enabing NGINX on Startup

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

- Disabling NGINX on Startup

```bash
sudo systemctl disable nginx 
```

- Testing the Configuration for Errors

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

- Running NGINX as a Background Process

```bash
sudo nginx
```

- Stopping NGINX without systemd

```bash
sudo nginx -s stop
```

- Reloading Configuration without Stopping NGINX

```bash
sudo nginx -s reload
```

- Checking Logs

    Access error or access logs to diagnose issues. On Ubuntu, logs are typically located at /var/log/nginx/.
- Error log:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

- Access log:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

- Running in Foreground (without systemd)

```bash
sudo nginx -g "daemon off;"
```

- Gracefully Shutting Down NGINX
    - Shuts down NGINX from the command line without systemctl.

```bash
sudo nginx -s quit
```

- Reopening Log Files

```bash
sudo nginx -s reopen
```

These commands cover the basics for managing NGINX on a Linux server, including routine maintenance, restarting, testing configurations, and checking the server’s status.
