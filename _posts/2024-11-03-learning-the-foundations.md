## Learning the Foundations

One of the first things I realized was the importance of building a strong foundation. Here are a few areas I've been focusing on:

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)
Learning **CI/CD** has been both challenging and rewarding. I’m experimenting with tools like **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI**, automating parts of the development pipeline to make sure everything runs smoothly. CI/CD is all about getting code changes to production faster and with fewer errors, and I’m constantly amazed at how these tools make it possible.
