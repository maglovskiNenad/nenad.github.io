### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Using tools like **Terraform** and **Ansible** has introduced me to **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, which allows infrastructure to be managed through code. This makes it easier to keep track of changes, and it’s a huge plus for scalability. Right now, I’m learning the basics of defining resources in Terraform and automating server configurations with Ansible.

### Monitoring and Log Management

Monitoring and logging are crucial for keeping systems stable and understanding what’s happening within them. I’m using **Prometheus** for metrics and **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to manage logs. It’s satisfying to set up these tools and see real-time data and insights into what’s happening.

## Challenges Along the Way 

One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced so far is **getting comfortable with the command line and scripting**. As a DevOps engineer, automation is key, and that often means writing scripts and commands. I’m focusing on learning **Bash** and **Python** for now, but there’s always something new to learn.

Another challenge has been **understanding complex cloud environments**. With platforms like **AWS, Azure, and GCP**, each has its own set of tools, configurations, and best practices. Right now, I’m focusing on learning the basics of AWS, but I hope to expand to other platforms soon.
