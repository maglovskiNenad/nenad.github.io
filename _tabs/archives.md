## Goals for the Next Few Months 

I’m setting some short-term goals to keep my learning structured and focused:

1. **Gain more hands-on experience with cloud platforms** like AWS and try deploying some small applications to see how different services interact.
2. **Improve my scripting skills** in both Bash and Python, especially focusing on automation tasks.
3. **Contribute to open-source projects** to build experience and connect with the DevOps community. There’s so much to learn from others, and I’m excited to give back!

## The Road Ahead

As I continue this journey, I’m motivated by how impactful DevOps can be in the real world. It’s amazing to think that the work I’m doing can help make software more reliable and efficient for users around the globe. I plan to keep sharing my progress and any insights I gain along the way, so stay tuned!
