# About Me

Hello! I am a junior DevOps engineer just starting out in the world of technology, with a strong passion for learning and exploring DevOps methodologies, tools, and processes. With the goal of contributing to modern IT teams and enhancing their systems, I'm currently focused on gaining the key knowledge and skills necessary for a successful DevOps career.

## My Current Experience

I am currently working on projects that allow me to develop my understanding of:
- **CI/CD Processes** – Working with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI to automate workflows and speed up the development cycle.
- **Docker and Virtualization** – Practicing with Docker containers to simplify application deployment and create consistent testing environments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Exploring Terraform and Ansible to learn how infrastructure can be efficiently managed and versioned.
- **Monitoring and Log Management** – Using tools like Prometheus and the ELK stack to monitor system performance and analyze data.

## My Goals

In the coming months, I plan to:
- Deepen my knowledge of **cloud platforms** like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- Enhance my **scripting skills** with a focus on Bash and Python for task automation.
- Contribute to open-source projects to gain hands-on experience working with the community and real-world environments.

My vision is to grow into a DevOps engineer who can contribute to system stability, security, and scalability while continuously improving team collaboration and delivery quality.
